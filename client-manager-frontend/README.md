# Client Manager Frontend

Welcome to the `Client Manager Frontend` application. This client-side application is designed for managing client information efficiently with functionalities that include searching clients by name, editing client details, and deleting client records.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v18.17.1)
- Yarn package manager

These prerequisites are necessary to install and run the application.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/purecodework/client-manager-frontend.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd client-manager-frontend

# Install dependencies
yarn install

```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the application using the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the application on `localhost:3000` where you can interact with the UI to manage client data.

## Future Roadmap

1. Robust Testing: Comprehensive unit (Jest, React Testing Library) and E2E (Cypress) tests.
2. Refined Styling: CSS Modules and mixins for maintainable, component-oriented styles.
3. State Management: As our business logic grows, we may consider integrating Redux or React Query to manage more complex state.
